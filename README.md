# Internship DAO for Students – Community-managed listings

## 1. Project Title
**Internship DAO for Students – Community-managed listings**

## 2. Project Description
This project is a **minimal Clarity smart contract** that allows students to **add and retrieve internship listings** in a decentralized, community-managed way.  
By using the Stacks blockchain, the listings are stored on-chain, ensuring transparency and removing the need for a central authority.

The contract currently supports:
- Adding a new internship listing.
- Retrieving internship details by ID.

## 3. Project Vision
To create a **student-driven decentralized platform** where:
- Internship opportunities are listed and verified by the community.
- Governance is handled by token holders or DAO participants.
- Listings remain transparent, tamper-proof, and accessible to all.

## 4. Future Scope
- Add governance mechanisms for approving/rejecting listings.
- Integrate a voting system for prioritizing internships.
- Enable reward mechanisms for students who contribute listings.
- Link with a frontend DApp for user-friendly interaction.
- Support metadata such as application links, deadlines, and stipend information.
